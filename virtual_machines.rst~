Why create a VM?
================

Advantages
----------

* Can test software installations in a sandbox before use, can revert changes if it doesn't work
* Can give the virtual machine with the software to the client (so they don't have to install anything to run the program)

Disadvantages
-------------

* Need enough RAM: need twice the amount of memory of the VMs
* Have to have enough disk space
* Have to have 64-bit CPU with virtualisation extensions

Process of Creating a VM
========================

Download Disk Image
-------------------

* Download the .iso file (64 bit) e.g. ubuntu-14.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso

`Ubuntu Desktop <http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop>`_

* Why Ubuntu:

 - It's the easiest one to get started 
 - There are loads of tutorials on how to use it

Create a New VirtualBox
-----------------------

* Download and Install Oracle VirtualBox:

`Oracle VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_

* Startup VirtualBox and create a new VM e.g.

 - Name: Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS
 - Type: Linux 
 - Version: Ubuntu 64 bit

Create Virtual Hard Drive
-------------------------

* Memory size (half of what is installed): 6GB
* Select option: Create a virtual harddrive now
* Select option: VirtualBox Disk Image (experience is that the other options don't work any better)
* Select option: Fixed size 40GB
* Hit "Create" (might take about 10 minutes or so)

You now have a virtual harddrive

Install Operating System
------------------------

* In VirtualBox > Settings > Storage > IDE (Empty)

  - Controller: IDE
  - Choose Ubuntu ISO Image

* In VirtualBox > Start 

 - Select: Install Ubuntu
 - Don't Select: Download updates while installing
   Gave username and password

 - Select: Continue
 - Select: Install Now
 - Where are you? UK
 - Detect Keyboard
 - Continue
 - When installation is complete:

   + Select: Restart Now
   + Ensure CD is removed: Press Enter
   + It restarts and asks for softare updated to be installed
   + I had to login as a guest and shutdown

**AT THIS POINT I CLONED THE VM AND WORKED ON THE CLONE (& ticked reinitilise network option)**

Change the Settings of the Virtual Machine
------------------------------------------

* In VirtualBox > Settings > System

  - 12MB or (64MB Video Memory)
  - Processor: change to 4 (needs virtualisation extensions)
  - Execution Cap: change to 50%

Run Updates for Ubuntu
----------------------

* In VirtualBox > Start 
* Run updates for Ubuntu

::

    $sudo apt-get update

Install DKMS
------------

* Install Dynamic Kernel Module Support – otherwise everytime you update kernel, you'll have to update Guest Additions

::

    $ sudo apt-get install dkms

Install VirtualBox Guest Additions
----------------------------------

* Install Guest Additions, which gives enhanced mouse pointer and video control and installs Vbox Service.
* Then Devices > Install Guest Additions (should open file system with CD) - use version that came with VirtualBox, not the version that is in the respository of Ubuntu
* This should appear on the desktop: VOXADDITIONS_4.3.12_93733
* Open Autorun Prompt > OK > Run > Authenticate with password > Press return
* Eject VM Guest Additions from File Manager
* Restart Ubuntu Guest

Pass Through Folder
-------------------

* There are loads of tutorials on this, the best on is this:

`Pass Through Folder <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iUafW6g5o8>`_

In Virtual Box:

Settings > Shared Folders:

Click plus button to add a new shared folder
    Folder Path: Other – Select Folder – Have a Folder Ready
    Folder Name: Documents

Restart Guest Machine

In Ubuntu:

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get samba

Right click folder > Share Folder (will install Samba) 

Restart session

$ sudo gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf &
[global]

   workgroup = WORKGROUP
   force user = pete (username in Ubuntu Box)

   [share]
             comment = Ubuntu File Server Share
             path = /srv/samba/share
             browsable = yes
             guest ok = yes
             read only = no
             create mask = 0755

$ sudo mkdir -p /srv/samba/share

$ sudo chown nobody.nogroup /srv/samba/share

$ sudo restart smbd

Right click folder > Share Folder Allow others to create and delete files, Guest access.

Create share

Create a file in Ubuntu to share

In Windows:

\\VMUbuntu\Public

Start > Network

(May need to turn on share and discovery)




--------

Create shared folder in Ubuntu

Within Guest Host:

Devices > Shared Folders

Add Shared Folder > Folder Path > Other (Select Windows Folder)

Add Folder Name

Don't have read-only or automount
Must make permanent (creates a Machine Folder)




Need to Map the Folder to a Network Drive in Ubuntu


How to Fix Host/Guest Copy Paste Issues

In Virtual Box:

Settings > General > Advanced

Shared Clipboard: Bidirectional
Drag n' Drop: Bidirectional


SnapShot Management 

Useful for software installation

Just running a operating system creates changes

Can't restore while machine is powered on

Right click > Restore snapshot 

Rick click > Take snapshop

Right click > Delete snapshot (to remove large files)

How to give other people the VM? Clone it

Can't give just snapshot

Clone snapshot Right click > Clone

If you are going to be using the clone on the same network as the virtual machine check reinitilise the MAC address of all network cards – otherwise you will have multiple machines with the same MAC address and this will confuse the network.

Full clone – so other people can use it

Clone everything

Can now give other people the .vdi file (the harddisk) and the .vbox. They can launch this directly in their copy of virtual box.

Adjust Network Adapter

Use: NAT (allows Guest to use Internet)

Adapter Type: PCnet-Fast III (Am79C973)

Can randomise MAC address. 08002731A607

Managing Media

Ubuntu uses SATA, CD uses IDE.

Virtual Media Manager

File > Virtual Media Manager

Differencing files are roughly equivalent to snapshots




How to Copy vdi files

.vdi files have unique identifiers – can't just copy and paste

If you want to copy a snapshot – you must use clone.

File > Virtual Media Manager > Copy > Next > Next > Next > Give it a name > Copy

To add the copy, you must add the vdi as an (additional) harddrive to a virtual machine (not just in the virtual machine manager)


How to Use Remote Desktop

Probably won't use
